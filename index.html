        <p>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets and it describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media. A common CSS stylesheet used by many developers is Bootstrap, and it is quite powerful and saves a lot of time when designing pages. So if you like styling and designing pages, then CSS and Design is for you!</p>

      <div class="result money improve back business purple web mobile likeMS" id="resultC#">
        <p>C# is one of the older programming languages that are still being used around the developer community due to its elegance and simplicity. It is backed by Microsoft, and naturally, it is designed to work with Microsoft's .NET platform. C# is also very versatile -- it can be used to create web applications, and mobile applications!</p>

      <div class="result money improve back ent coffee web mobile hateMS" id="resultJava">

        <p> PHP is an acronym for "PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor" and is widely-used, open source scripting language. It is FREE to download and use! It is popularly used by blogging sites like WordPress, and even the largest social networking site Facebook! It runs on various platforms and compatible with almost all servers today.

      <div class="result money improve back startup red web game hateMS" id="resultRuby">
        <p> Gems are truly, truly outrageous! (If you get that reference then high five to you!) Anyway, Ruby is a favorite among developrs that build interactive web apps. Thanks to the Rails framework, also written by Ruby, it garnered more attention because it simplified many of the common tasks that comes with building web apps. Ruby on Rails are very popular among startups and smaller companies who want to build their product quickly. It is considered as the most elegant and simplest language up to date, and it is very easy to learn. Give it a shot!</p>
