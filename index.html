          <p>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets and it describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media. A common CSS stylesheet used by many developers is Bootstrap, and it is quite powerful and saves a lot of time when designing pages. So if you like styling and designing pages, then CSS and Design is for you!</p>

          <p> Gems are truly, truly outrageous! (If you get that reference then high five to you!) Anyway, Ruby is a favorite among developrs that build interactive web apps. Thanks to the Rails framework, also written by Ruby, it garnered more attention because it simplified many of the common tasks that comes with building web apps. Ruby on Rails are very popular among startups and smaller companies who want to build their product quickly. It is considered as the most elegant and simplest language up to date, and it is very easy to learn. Give it a shot!</p>
